Simple Math Worksheet Generator for Infants (Addition & Subtraction)

This Python script generates multiple unique PDF worksheets designed for infants or young children learning basic one- and two-digit addition and subtraction. It is built to create print-ready documents with a clear, large font and a predictable layout.

‚ú® Features

Batch Generation: Generates 10 unique PDF worksheets in a single run.

Problem Count: Each worksheet contains 100 randomized problems.

Responsive Layout: Problems are arranged in a 2-column layout with no serial numbering.

Print-Ready Pages: Each PDF file is paginated to contain exactly 20 problems per page (resulting in 5 pages per worksheet).

Safe Math: All problems ensure the sum is less than or equal to 20 and subtraction results are non-negative.

Aesthetics: Uses a 16pt bold font and centered alignment for optimal readability.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

You must have Python 3 installed on your system.

This script relies on the ReportLab library to handle PDF generation.
